# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this challenge was to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Dana's webpage and dynamic table work as intended, but she wanted to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. Using JavaScript, the intitial function was replaced with a new function updateFilters() to save the element, value, and id of the filter that was changed. We then created a new function, filterTable() to loop through the dataset and keep only the results that match the search criteria. 


## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
In order to use the filter for multiple criteria at the same time, you simply head over to the 'Filter Search' area. Below the Filter Search, there are spaces where users can enter each a criteria in order to locate specific data.<br>

As you can see below, the placeholder already has a city written in to give an example for users. Within the space, users will be able to type in the specific city (as shown in the image below) state, country, or the shape that they may want to search to better inspect the data for their personal use.

## Summary: 
One drawback of this webpage may be the large amount of data that is initially shown on the site. If users are not aware of where exactly UFOs were seen, they would able to go through the entire list before filtering for a specific date or location. It could be frustrating and time consuming for the user through a large amount of data. Another drawback would be that the data listed could not have been up to date. 
It would be beneficial for users to include images of each UFO sighting so that they could have a better view of the comments included with each sighting. 
Another recommendation would be to adjust the html file so that the webpage can be easily accessed and viewed whether it accessed through a computer, tablet, or mobile phone.
